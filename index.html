    <h2 class="about-title">About / Impact</h2>

    <p class="about-text">
      Over the last one year, I’ve been seriously building my foundation in frontend
      engineering, UI clarity, and performance-focused web design.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      I previously co-founded a student-led agency, SparkEdge, where we generated
      ₹30K+ revenue in 3 months with zero prior industry knowledge — purely by testing
      ideas, iterating fast, and delivering design and editing services at scale across India.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      After pausing the agency due to limited growth opportunities, I consciously shifted
      my focus to deep skill building. I’ve now restarted SparkEdge with a stronger technical
      base and a clear long-term vision.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      I enjoy breaking unclear ideas into structured systems that actually work.
    </p>
